The caret must be placed between the indentation and the code, the box appears after some seconds, the displayed lines depends of the **indentation** of the **current line** and of the **number of availables lines** above of the current line (minus lines_gap, see below).
The box is hidden when the caret is moved, when the script is changed, scrolled or resized, or when the box is overflyied.
When the horizontal scrolling is greater than zero (or almost) the box is not displayed.

The used editor settings are:
* Text Editor > Background Color
* Text Editor > Text Color
* Text Editor > Keyword Color
* Text Editor > Line Number Color
* Text Editor > Syntax Highlighting
* Text Editor > Show Line Numbers
* Text Editor > Font
